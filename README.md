# Initial requirements

You should have the following files in your directory:

- Install virtual environment with all packages:
  ```
  python3 -m venv my_new_env
  source my_new_env/bin/activate
  pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
  ```

- `.token`. It is a file that simply contains the grafana-cloud token.

- `influxdb_config.py`. This is a python script with the following variables: `token`, `ORG`, `url` and `BUCKET`, which are all information about your InfluxDB database.

# Files in the repository

Find below a brief description of the files in this repository:

- `monitor_compressor.py`. This script retrieves information from the compressor and saves it to a database. Please make sure the compressor is connected to the network, otherwise the connection to the computer cannot be established -- this is often done by forwarding the network from the computer via an ethernet cable.

- `monitor_ctc100.py`. This script retrieves information from the ctc100 device and saves it to a database. Please make sure the usb port used by the ctc100 device is set to executable, otherwise the connection to the computer cannot be established.

- `monitor_labjack.py`. This script retrieves information from the labjack device and saves it to a database.

- `measure_baseline.py`. This script collects the vddd, vdda, iddd and idda for all pacman tiles, as well as the mean pedestal and the number of packets of each channel. The information is then saved into a dictionary, an influxdb database, or both. Read description for more information.

# How to run scripts

1. **Network to compressor**. The very first thing is to make sure that the compressor is receiving network connection. Go to "wired connections" and check if the network is active for compressor. Then, physically disconnect the usb cable leading to the compressor, wait 5 seconds, and connect it again. The network connection should have been established by now.

2. **Run script to collect data**. In principle you should be able to simply run the script below. It will start influxdb, grafana-cloud server and run the scripts that collect information from compressor, ctc100 and labjack, each one in a different terminal.
    ```
    source syracuse_start_monitoring_all_variables.sh
    ```
    However, if you want to run the scripts for the compressor, ctc100 and labjack individually, do the following.
   
    Make sure grafana-cloud and influxdb-server is active
    ```
    source start_grafana_cloud.sh
    
    sudo systemctl start influxdb
    sudo systemctl enable influxdb
    ```
    Then, open three different terminals:
    ```
    # on terminal 1
    source /home/syr-neutrino/Desktop/Longevity_Test/larpix/bin/activate
    sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0
    python3 monitor_compressor.py
    
    # on terminal 2
    source /home/syr-neutrino/Desktop/Longevity_Test/larpix/bin/activate
    python3 monitor_labjack.py
    
    # on terminal 3
    source /home/syr-neutrino/Desktop/Longevity_Test/larpix/bin/activate
    python3 monitor_ctc100.py
    ```
